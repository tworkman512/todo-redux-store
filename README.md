# todo-redux-store
---

Welcome.

I'm using this project to help me learn more about the Redux library. I have slowly built a custom Redux store and eventually added in the Redux library. The UI has been purposely left simple, so that I could focus Redux.

I will adding React to handle the UI, so I can gain a better understanding of how React and Redux work so well together.
